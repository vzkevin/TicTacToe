# Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, with a command-line interface. The game features a "human vs. computer" mode, with two types of computer AI strategies: a random choice AI and a smart AI using a minimax algorithm for decision making.

## Usage

To play the game, run TicTacToe.py. You will be prompted to input a number corresponding to the position on the board where you want to place your piece. The board positions are numbered as follows:

0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8
