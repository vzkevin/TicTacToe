# Tic Tac Toe

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, with a command-line interface. The game features a "human vs. computer" mode, with two types of computer AI strategies: a random choice AI and a smart AI using a minimax algorithm for decision making.

## Usage

To play the game, run TicTacToe.py. You will be prompted to input a number corresponding to the position on the board where you want to place your piece. The board positions are numbered as follows:

## 0 | 1 | 2

## 3 | 4 | 5

## 6 | 7 | 8

## Game Mechanics

The game features two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If all the spaces on the board are marked and there's no winner, then the game is a draw.

## AI Strategies

**SmartComputerPlayer:** This AI player uses the minimax algorithm to make its move. The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm for minimizing the worst-case potential loss or maximizing the potential gain. This AI is unbeatable.
